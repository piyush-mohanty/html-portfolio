<h1>The Best Movies According to Piyush</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<b>- Studio Ghibli (2001)</b>
<p>This movie is a masterpiece, and my favorite anime.
It has so many great themes such as family bonds, friendship, loss/grief etc
and its animation style makes me feel like im watching something from another world altogether which i really enjoy.</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<b>- David Fincher (1999)</b>
<p>I love this film because it is 
so darkly humorous! It's also very thought provoking as well. I think the
message behind Fight club was that you should never give up on yourself or others around you no matter
what they do wrong in life.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<b>- Christopher Nolan (2014)</b>
<p>Amazing story about time traveling through space with some really cool visual effects thrown into the mix too.
